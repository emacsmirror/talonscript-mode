<h1 align=center>TalonScript-Mode</h1>
<p align=center>Major mode for interacting with .talon files from [Talon Voice](https://talonvoice.com/).

At the time of writing, .talon files are newapi only.</p>

## Overview

This is currently a simple major mode. It just adds syntax highlighting and comment syntax.

## Usage

For now, clone this repo directly, make sure it's on the load-path, then `(require 'talonscript-mode)`. 

Down the line I intend to add [Quelpa](https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa) compatibility, and I'll probably eventually get it on [MELPA](https://melpa.org/).
